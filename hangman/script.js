// comp picks random ltr
/*10 guesses if you cant guess letter in 10 turns you lose

a user should see # of wins losses and the current # of turns left

a user shoud be able to click on a letter button to register a guess

when guess is registered we shgoudl show winng message if the guess is correct remove 1 from total guesses

nice to have: allow user to have keyboard inputs as well as the ltr buttons
    nice to have: disable a button if the choice is already registered.

    Display guesses that were wrong.*/
